            <td><p>From Wikipedia,<i>the free encyclopedia</i> </p><p>A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.<sup>[1][2][3][4]</sup> Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a <strong>marklet tree</strong>, where data nodes are represented by leaves)</p>
                <p>Blockchains are typically managed by a <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-p2ppeer-to-peer-process/">peer-to-peer</a></p>
                <p>A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.<sup>[6]</sup> The implementation of the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications[3][2] and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by <a href="https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/definitions/what-is-cryptocurrency">cryptocurrencies</a>. <strong>The blockchain may be considered a type of payment rail.</strong><sub>[7]</sub></p>

            <td>Cryptographer David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like <a href="https://medium.com/@genesishack/draft-what-are-blockchain-protocols-and-how-do-they-work-94815be5efa7">Protocol</a>protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established, Maintained, and <em>Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups</em>."[10] Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.<sup>[4][11]</sup>
                The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks without requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.[3]</td>
